#Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

###10 steps

1. Create index.html and styles.css files.
2. Link the styles.css file to the index.html file.
3. Look at the provided mockups and add the same header, titles, content and footer information into your index.html file.
4. Use appropriate HTML markup for each piece of content.
5. Use the images provided for the portfolio images.
6. Provide an image for your about picture to reflect the placement and sizing in the mockup.
7. Use CSS to style your portfolio to look like the ones in the mockup.
8. Add media queries to create a responsive style that matches the three breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop) and styles provided in the mockups.
9. Put your project in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account:
 * See the Workshop 'Share Your Projects With GitHub Desktop' in the Project Resources. The GitHub Desktop application can automatically create a new repository for you.
 * Make sure that you're only putting the files for this project in that repository.
10. Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.
 * Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
 * There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:
  * Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
  * If CSS validator flags use of calc, or vendor prefixes these errors should be ignored.
  * If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.

#Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

###4 steps
1. Add folders to organize different files types like images, and stylesheets.
2. Add additional relevant content such as extra images, information or even extra pages.
3. Provide semantic classes where appropriate, like <nav> for a navigation bar.
 * Try to think of class names that describe what a certain element represents, and that are not likely to change.
 * For example, the “main-nav” will always remain the main navigation, no matter how much the look of the page changes.
4. Add additional color or layout styling to the CSS to enhance the portfolio.
 *Think about background and text colors. Just make sure you leave the basic layout the same as the mockup.
